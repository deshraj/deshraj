I'm Co-founder and CTO of [Embedchain](https://embedchain.ai). I like to tinker with new technologies and build useful tools.

- ðŸ”­ Previously, I worked as Senior Autopilot Engineer at [Tesla](http://tesla.com/autopilotai) where I lead the AI Platform.
- ðŸŒ± I had built [EvalAI](https://eval.ai/) as my [masters thesis](https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/60738) at Georgia Tech, which is an open source platform for evaluating and comparing machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms at scale.
- âš¡ I co-founded [Caliper](https://medium.com/caliper/introducing-caliper-3109fbd84513). Failed but learned a lot.

ðŸ“« I'm best reached via [email](https://deshraj.xyz). I'm always open to interesting collaborations and hacking open source projects over the weekends.
